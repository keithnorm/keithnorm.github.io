This immaturity leads to things not working as well as expected, which lead to a huge problem at Green Bits - to the tune of nearly 1 million sales that should have been reported to the state, not being reported. I took on the challenge of chipping away at that mountain of technical debt, and by the time I was done the mountain was virtually eliminated, the product was working better than it ever had, and customer satisfaction was improving.</p>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"slug":"green-bits","title":""}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
