It scrolls vertically and swipes horizontally.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<h2>My Role</h2>\n<p>I was one of three developers on the first iOS team at Good Eggs. I convinced the leadership at Good Eggs to make an iOS app by making a prototype while on my Caltrain commute and showing them how beautiful the ux could be, and how nice the Good Eggs photography would look in the iOS form factor. Secretly, I just wanted to greenfield an app after inheriting legacy debt for so long at my previous jobs, and it worked!</p>\n<p>This was one of the best teams I worked on and I learned so much from all my teammates. I also got to be part of the full research, ideation, and teting phases of the design process. We went to people's homes to interview them about their shopping habits; we took pictures of people's refrigerators.</p>\n<p>I wrote most of the code that laid the foundation for the app. We had a very slick Core Data integrated networking layer and pursued something resembling a MVVM architecture driven by NSFetchedResultsController.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clearfix\" style=\"margin-bottom: 20px\">\n  <figure class=\"float-unless-mobile\" style=\"width: 300px; margin-right: 20px;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/goodeggs-2.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n    <figcaption>The entire app is deep-linkable because there is a central router - no hardcoding transitions</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<h2>Some More Technical Bits</h2>\n<p>I've been a big fan of CSS for my entire career and I didn't forget about it when I switched from web to native mobile development. The entire Good Eggs app is styled using <a href=\"https://github.com/keithnorm/RecordCollection\">Classy</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">\n  <figure class=\"float-unless-mobile\" style=\"width: 300px; margin-right: 20px;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/goodeggs-3.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n    <figcaption>Clean and minimal checkout screen</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<h2>What I'm Super Proud Of</h2>\n<p>Really, this whole app. But, I got to \"own\" the checkout experience. It may not be the sexiest work, but it's important and you don't want to mess it up. Once we integrated Apple Pay into the checkout flow the entire experience just felt so seamless and perfect.</p>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"slug":"good-eggs","title":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"good-eggs"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
