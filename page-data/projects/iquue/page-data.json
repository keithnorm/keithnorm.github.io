My role on this project was lead (and only) developer.</p>\n<p>The app is an isomorphic React app that makes heavy use of Redux, Redux Saga, and this cool little abstraction on top of HTML5 IndexedDB called <a href=\"https://github.com/erikolson186/zangodb\">ZangoDB</a>.</p>\n<p>I've been chasing the holy grail of isomorphic apps ever since my <a href=\"https://github.com/keithnorm/SpainJS-Pipedream-Demo\">pipedream presentation</a> that I gave at SpainJS several years ago. This project is the closest I've come to realizing this dream yet.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">\n  <figure class=\"float-unless-mobile\" style=\"width: 300px; margin-right: 20px;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/iquue-dashboard.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n    <figcaption>The desktop UI. The chart at the top shows water usage an entire apartment complex per day.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<h2>Some More Technical Bits</h2>\n<p>The app integrates with SmartThings API in order to allow the control of z-wave enabled devices: locks, thermostats, lights, etc. The app receives also receives a constant stream of status data from these connected devices. Every someone flips on a light, changes a thermostat, or unlocks a door, the app gets pinged by SmartThings, it records the event, and pushes the event out (through SSE) to any relevant currently connected clients.</p>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"slug":"iquue","title":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"iquue"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
